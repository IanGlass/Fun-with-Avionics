# Fun-with-Avionics

The goal of the project is to provide automated control, where the desired orientation and height are the input parameters, of a RC helicopter using the LM3S1968 development kit. Automated height control is achieved with a PID system reading height as an analogue voltage and orientation control using quadrature encoding. Helicopter main and tail rotor control is achieved with a PWM output.

The attached document has pseudocode style descriptions of the code.
